# ParallelKaratsuba

## Usage Instructions

- Compile:
  - ThreadPool: `g++ -std=c++2a Karatsuba_ThreadPool.cpp -pthread`
  - Semaphores: `g++ -std=c++2a Karatsuba_Semaphores.cpp -pthread`
    - Make sure your compiler supports semaphores.

- Execute:
  - `./a.out`

## Challenges
- Learning how to use Latex
- Creating a comprehensive testing plan
- Figure out how to bring down the constant factor of the runtime

## Tasks
These represent what section each of us is assigned to write:
- Xavier: `Semaphores` and `Threadpools`
- Esteban: `Introduction` and `Background`
- Naim: `Related Work` and `Experimental Results`
- Asir: `Testing` and `Anticipated And Encountered Challenges`
- Victor: `Conclusion` and `Discussion`

## Goals
- Run our testing plan and stress tests to obtain data
- Finish writing our Paper
- Improve the constant factor runtime
